"# agoda_homepage_copy" 

I copied the Agoda homepage to practise my HTML and CSS. 

The images in the programme are all download from different websites and most of the content are copied from Agoda. 
I also generated some nonsense just to demonstrate the design.

I now have better understanding about flexbox & grid and be able to use simple JavaScript to manipulate some mouse actions. This is the first website design i did, as a self-taught programmer, I have been learning HTML/CSS/JS for 2-3 months, I'm very pround of myself be able to complete this task.

Something I learned from this project:
1. Go through the whole design before starting to coding.
2. Write down all the strutures and the common design standard in the website.
3. For each section, do the responsive design at the same time.
